# HQCCNN

Here we implement the Hybrid Quantum Classical Convolutional Neural Network (HQCCNN) described in the paper [An Image Classification Algorithm Based on Hybrid Quantum Classical Convolutional Neural Network](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/que/2022/5701479/) by Li et al.  This paper utilized the HQCCNN to classify handwritten digits from the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.  Here we employ the model to classify land cover from the [DeepSat4](https://csc.lsu.edu/~saikat/deepsat/) dataset. As the images from this dataset contain 4 channels instead of the single channels present in MNIST, we first collapse the channels into a single channel using a pixel-wise mean, and then downsample to the required input shape of the network using an average pooling operation.  Moreover, due to limited availability of computing power, we take only 10000 images for training and testing with a 90%-10% split respectively.
